On the entire continent of Africa, if you remove Egypt and South Africa, there are only 6 paediatric radiologists. In Nigeria there are fewer than 60 radiologists for 190 million people. In Mexico there are only about 4,000 radiologists for 130 million people. In Japan there are only 36 radiologists per million people. In the entire country of Liberia there are only 2 radiologists. Fourteen African countries have no radiologists at all. One hospital in Boston, Massachusetts General Hospital, has 126 radiologists.

BASR's AI application system will help increase access to care in places where radiologists are not there or are inaccessible. BASR's AI has the potential to enable anyone near a SINSO Box or with a smartphone to have access to healthcare. Our developers are working towards extending the reach of care outside of hospitals and clinics. This is especially important for people living in the developing world and for people working in remote environments either on remote villages or Africa, Latin America, Antarctica or in space.

BASR AI will help improve workflow and efficiency. It is estimated that in the UK at any time there are over 300,000 radiographs that wait over 30 days to be read by a radiologist. Using AI will reduce delays in identifying and acting on abnormal medical images. This is especially important in chest and brain imaging where time is critical. According to GE Healthcare, over 90% of healthcare data comes from medical imaging and more than 97% of medical images are not analysed. 40% of all diagnostic imaging performed worldwide are images of the chest (newsroom.gehealthcare.com).

Another big advantage with AI is increased levels of accuracy in detecting and diagnosing disease. Breast cancer is the second most common cancer among women and conventional mammogram screening misses 1 in 5 cancers. Although breast cancer is treatable in its early stages, once the disease has advanced and spread it is considered incurable. According to a paper published in The American Journal of Surgical Pathology, Google's AI powered Lymph Node Assistant (LYNA) can detect breast cancer metastasis with 99% accuracy (Liu et al. 2018). Human pathologists miss metastases as much as 62% of the time but AI algorithms evaluate exhaustively resulting in extremely high accuracy.
