### AI + Blockchain are the Future of Healthcare

### Combined AI and IPFS technology , BASR led Healthcare industry to go into the Web3.0 era ——Metaverse!

In practice, radiologists often fail to see, misconstrue, or fail to mention findings, that mostly have no clinical consequence, but occasionally sometimes such missed results in substantial outcomes.

This is not because of a lack of a system or that the radiologists in question are incompetent, it is because radiologists look too fast, and in the worst-case scenario, are financially incentivized to look too fast.

BASR’s AI and ML based analysis of medical images eliminates human errors and assist prescribing doctors in making an accurate diagnosis and suggesting an appropriate treatment plan. This can change the course of the prognosis and helps in early and speedy recovery of a patient.

BASR also utilizes IPFS distributed data storage technology. Realize the permanent and complete preservation of all patient medical data, data privacy security and data transaction security issues. The patient's medical data belongs to the patient, and these encrypted data are used as the patient's digital assets in the form of NFT, which can be used for transactions and obtain corresponding income. And it would be the best application for IoMTs as well.

## AI IN MEDICAL IMAGING

Applications of artificial intelligence in health care are expanding rapidly. Soon every medical imaging machine will be connected to the cloud where AI algorithms will analyze data and help human doctors screen, assess, and diagnose patients. But the centralized Cloud Storage also brings new difficulties. such as, data privacy & security, permanent and complete storage of data, data management and transmission etc. IPFS technology will completely solve those problems.

The potential impact of implementing AI to analyze medical images is huge. For Example:

99% Accuracy of Breast Cancer Diagnosis by AI

99% Accuracy of Breast Cancer Diagnosis by AI

700% increase in academic publications of AI in radiology over 10 years

## 9 USE CASES

- AI TO AUGMENT DOCTORS

In the near future, AI will augment doctors to help find the key, relevant data and present it in a concise, easily digestible format

- AI HELP DETECT CANCER

Scientists have created an AI that can detect breast cancer with high levels of accuracy.

- AI CAN FILL LABOR GAPS

Many countries lack enough radiologists and AI can fill a labor gap by analyzing various medical images.

- AI HELP FIND BEST IMAGE SETTINGS

AI is helping medical professionals determine the best imaging settings during capture to reduce radiation and increase accuracy of images

- REDUCES ARTIFACTS IN MEDICAL IMAGES

AI applied post image capture enhances images and reduces artifacts and abnormalities caused by the capture process.

- DIAGNOSE AND CATEGORIZE CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES

ML offers a non-invasive way to analyze images of cardiac computed tomography.

- IPFS TECHNOLOGY MAKE THE DATA PERMANENT AND COMPLETE AND SAFETY

The IPFS protocol uses its distributed data storage features to achieve the medical data security and privacy, data transmission is more secure, data management is easier, and data is completely and permanently stored, etc

- PATIENT MEDICAL DATA BECOMES PERSONAL NFT DIGITAL ASSETS

In a distributed network, all medical data of patients belong to the patients themselves, and patients can treat their medical data as NFT digital assets, which can be traded in a dedicated market place to obtain benefits. For example: When any institution, research center, laboratory, etc. needs data, it must obtain consent from the patient or pay for it. Otherwise, the patient's medical data cannot be retrieved or read directly.

- DOCTORS OR MEDICAL RESEARCHERS CAN SELL ANY OF THEIR VALUABLE WORKS AS NFT DIGITAL ASSETS IN THE MARKET PLACE
