## Malawi Medical Aid Project.

Malawi is located in southern Africa and is one of the least developed
countries in the world, with a population of 20 million. Health services in
Malawi are provided by public, private for profit (PFP) and private not for
profit (PNFP) sectors. The public sector includes all health facilities under
the Ministry of Health (MOH), district, town and city councils, Ministry of
Defence, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Public Security (Police and
Prisons) and the Ministry of Natural Resources, Energy and Mining. Public
provision of health care is enshrined in the republican constitution which
states that the State is obliged “to provide adequate health care, commensurate with the health needs of Malawian society and
international standards of health care”. However, Malawi’s medical
resources are extremely unbalanced. Through medical assistance projects, we provide Sinso’s full set of telemedicine service platforms, and other
aid providers provide medical equipment. The first step is to provide high- quality services to residents in underdeveloped areas through the Internet. Diagnosis and online consultation services in this way can greatly remind
the effective use of medical resources, so that patients can receive high- quality and low-cost medical services.

Through IPFS and blockchain technology, local residents who are
connected to the network have their own medical record system. Because
there is almost no IT infrastructure upgrade problem before, they can
upgrade to the latest architecture in one step, and use the blockchain to
incentivize ways to strengthen the residents to actively participate in the
management of personal health enthusiasm, and called the world more
doctors to serve the people of Malawi.The current project is under
construction and progress, and the progress of the project will continue to
be announced on the official website.
