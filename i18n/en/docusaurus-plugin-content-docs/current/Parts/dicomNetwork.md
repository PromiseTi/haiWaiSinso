DicomNetwork It is an open source public welfare project with many excellent programmers from medical Internet companies. With the rapid spread of covid-19 epidemic, our existing systems are very closed. We need to build a medical image diagnosis network platform with better sharing, lowest cost, simplest use and more convenient cooperation. Doctors and patients only need email to cooperate. They don't need to register or log in. They just need to send a request email, upload their DICOM file and send it to the designated doctor or doctor's volunteer network to get the corresponding diagnosis. We hope to help millions of people in trouble through DICOM network.
