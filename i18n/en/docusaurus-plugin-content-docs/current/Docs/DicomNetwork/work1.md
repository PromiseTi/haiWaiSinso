DicomNetwork is an open source public welfare project, many team members are excellent programmers from medical Internet companies.With the rapid spread of the COVID-19 epidemic, our existing systems are very closed. We need to build a medical imaging diagnosis network platform with better sharing, lowest cost, easiest to use, and more convenient collaboration. Both the doctor and the patient can collaborate with only the email address, no registration or login is required. You only need to send a request email, upload your own DICOM file, and send it to the designated doctor or the doctor’s volunteer network to get the corresponding diagnosis. We hope to help thousands of people in distress through DicomNetwork.

（Dicom is the abbreviation of digital imaging and communications in medicine. It is an international standard. Most imaging devices in the world use the same standard for communication and transmission.）
