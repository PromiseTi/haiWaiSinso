DicomNetwork builds a medical image storage service network in the medical field as soon as possible, adopting an open source community approach, not a company approach. If we received the donation, we mainly recruited more volunteer doctors for global expansion, so that patients around the world, especially COVID-19 patients, can fight the epidemic.

For those participating in the project, regardless of the amount, we will hold targeted airdrops (the tokens for the airdrops come from other projects’ donations to DicomNetwork, and we will feed back most of them to everyone, especially community contributors).
Any amount you donate (once or recurring) is very welcome.
And most importantly join us, human!
