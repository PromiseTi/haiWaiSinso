web3 medical labs is an independent open source organization. Compared with the developer organizations "kidnapped" by some traditional large manufacturers, web3 medical labs is more free. The developers of web3 medical labs do not need to be attached to the ecology of a large manufacturer for advocacy and conformity, but only need to receive donations and bonuses in accordance with the rules. And various token rewards, while freely providing "technical consultation" and "customized development" to commercial users to get the benefits and rewards they deserve.The most basic attribute of an open source foundation is "neutrality." One of its functions is to protect open source projects from the control of a commercial company through legal and other means, allowing users and contributors participate in peace of mind without worrying about losing their own interests. In the world of blockchain, what we emphasize is "code is law", and we can see that "law" is driven by code. We can naturally combine incentives with the open source community through the DAC governance structure. This is a very anticipated direction of practice.
