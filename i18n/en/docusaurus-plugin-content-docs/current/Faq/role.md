## User

Many users themselves may be code users (at the same time as the developer community themselves), we have a variety of codes, and may also be able to see highly mature commercial software prototypes. Direct users also include patients and doctors. They can get what they need from the code library. Many codes are very productive and can even save a patient's life when necessary.

## Contributor

The code and works of open source projects are created, tested, used, discussed and optimized by members of the project community. These processes require people with different skills and different levels of participation. Therefore, the open source community is not just purely technical or programming work. Writing or updating documents, translating, recommending the project to others, organizing offline events, etc. are all contributors.

## Committer

Committer usually accumulates various contributions in the daily operation of the project, is nominated and recognized by the core maintenance team of the project, and finally becomes a committer from general contributors, and has higher authority in open source projects. They are developers who have permission to write and operate the code repository.In general, committer has the authority of the code warehouse to submit code directly, and usually has the right to review other people's code to determine whether it can be merged and submitted. As a participant in an open source project, being a committer is an honor in itself, and it is also a very important reason to encourage everyone to continue to participate and keep the community healthy. For example, becoming a committer for Linux may be the small dream of many open source project engineers.

## Maintainer

The user who is committed to a project and promotes the development of the project is often the initiator or owner of the open source project, or it can be a team. They have the highest decision-making power in the open source project, and determine the function, strategy, and development direction of the project. SINSO is the initiator of web3 medical labs. Of course, the founder of SINSO represents the SINSO team as the maintainer of this project, but web3 medical labs does not belong to SINSO. We need a board member, and we will set up a project management committee to conduct regular decision-making and voting meetings.
